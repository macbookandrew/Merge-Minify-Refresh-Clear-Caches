This plugin clears other page caches/proxies when the Merge + Minify + Refresh cache is regenerated.

## Description ##

This plugin clears other page caches/proxies when the [Merge + Minify + Refresh](https://wordpress.org/plugins/merge-minify-refresh/) cache is regenerated so users don’t end up missing static resources (CSS/JS files) due to a cached page trying to load old static resources.

Note that every time the Merge + Minify + Refresh cache is purged, your page cache and proxies will be purged as well, forcing them to regenerate the cache.

1. Activate the plugin through the “Plugins” menu in WordPress
1. Enjoy!
1. Optional: you can force-clear all caches under “Settings > MMR Force Clear Caches”

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Can I clear only specific pages from the cache? ###
